In the echo system of Linux OS, Files properties management are categorized in two.

File Ownerships
File Permissions
When a file created inside a system, that file has to be associated to a user which is Owner and also a group which is Group Owner.

When we create a file the ownerships to that file is getting the information from the user whom created that file.

You can check the ownerships of a file using ls -l command.

touch sample.txt ls -l sample.txt

When we want to change the ownership we use chown command. When we want to change the group ownership then we use chgrp command. To change ownership:

chown centos sample.txt ls -l sample.txt

To change group ownership:

groupadd devops chgrp devops sample.txt ls -l sample.txt

In above situation you are dealing with a file, If that is a directory then use -R option along with both the commands.

One more thing from the above situation is we are using two commands to change the owner and group, Where as we can do that with one single command.

chown centos:devops sample.txt ls -l sample.txt chown root:root sample.txt ls -l sample.txt

Permissions of a file telling that which owner can do what.

The operations performed on the file are

read (r )
write (w )
execute (x )
Owners of a file are three

File Owner (u )
Group Owner (g )
Others as Owners. (o )
Following diagram illustrates the output of ls -l command showing the permissions.

Now we can change those permissions using chmod command.

touch sample.txt ls -l sample.txt chmod ugo+rwx sample.txt ls -l sample.txt

Those options can be used in the way shown in the following diagram.
