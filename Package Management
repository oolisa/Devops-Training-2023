Package Management 
---------------------

Package Management is the key admin activity that most of the time as a DevOps guy we deal with. We need to install / update the packages all the time.

In RedHat OS and its family like CentOS, they use RPM (Redhat Package Manager), So the softwares we download will have an extension ending with .rpm like .msi in windows.

First, In case if we want to list out the packages which are installed in your system then..

sudo yum list installed

At the same time we can also get the packages which are not installed and also available for installation from remote repositories.

sudo yum list available

In case if we want both the packages which are installed and available for install then we can use a flag list ..

sudo yum list all

Above command would bombard with thousands of lines output and can be piped to filter the content.

sudo yum list all | grep nginx

To install a package

sudo yum install nginx

Above command will interrupt for an input whether to proceed with an installation or not. To avoid the interruption we can use -y option.

sudo yum install nginx -y

To remove / erase a package in the system

sudo yum remove nginx -y

To update a package

sudo yum update nginx -y

To update the complete system

sudo yum update -y

However, if you wondered that how yum in managing the installation, You will see that it is downloading the package and installing it. But from where it is downloading?

Command yum will refer the repos available under /etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo files and reach out to only those destinations to download the files.

Let us understand it through a situation.

sudo yum list | grep jenkins -y

Above command will try to install Jenkins software but it will be a failure, So let us download a repo file and check it.

Check list of repos

ls /etc/yum.repos.d

Download Jenkins repo

curl -s https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo

Check list of repos now.

ls /etc/yum.repos.d

Now after importing those new repo files you would be able to install Jenkins software

sudo yum list | grep jenkins -y

We can also install a package using the URL directly.

sudo yum install https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins-2.190.2-1.1.noarch.rpm -y
